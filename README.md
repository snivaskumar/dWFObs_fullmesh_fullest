Developed by Doekemeijer et al., Delft University of Technology, 2017
            


## Summary:
WindFarmObserver (WFObs) is a collection of state estimators for the nonlinear dynamic flow model WindFarmSimulator (WFSim). The states are the time-varying two-dimensional flow fields in a wind farm. This state information can be used in real-time for state-feedback control algorithms, see work by Vali et al.

## Quick use:
Make sure you clone the repository recursively, by
	
	git clone https://github.com/TUDelft-DataDrivenControl/WFObs --recursive

Once downloaded, open WFObs_demo.m with any recent version of MATLAB. Follow the instructions therein to perform offline estimation simulations of various wind farm scenarios. If necessary, high-fidelity data will be automatically downloaded within WFSim.
	
## Folder hierarchy:

	/bin/:            contains all the functions and scripts used by WFObs.
	/cluster_jobs/:   contains a folder with a demo code to run WFObs on a Linux cluster
	/configurations/: contains the settings files for various simulation scenarios
	/dev_tools/:      contains scripts to analyse results, import raw LES data, and other tools useful for debugging and development
	/setup_sensors/:  contains scripts that will allow you to set up the location of measurements, and generate the relevant input file
	
	/WFSim/:          contains all the model information, identical to the original repository (https://github.com/TUDelft-DataDrivenControl/WFSim)
